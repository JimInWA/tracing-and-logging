Web.config file in SimpleMathService (WCF service) was modified just enough to allow the hooks:
- system.serviceModel
	- behaviors
		- new endpointBehaviors section (this includes the debugDispatcher which is part of the extension section listed below)
	- new bindings section (this has the binding name used in the services section listed below)
	- new services section (this includes behaviorConfiguration, which seems to be the hook to the new endpointBehavior section)
	- new extension section (this includes the debugDispatcher listed in the endpointBehaviors section above)

In the SoapRequestAndResponseTracing project, set breakpoints on all of the methods and properties

Set the SimpleMathService project as the start up project

Set the AdditionOperatioins.svc as the start page

Press F5 to start up the WCF Test Client

Based on the breakpoints, here is the flow in the SoapRequestAndResponseTracing project:

1. DebugMessageBehaviorElement
- BehaviorType property, get
- BehaviorType property, get
- BehaviorType property, get
- BehaviorType property, get
- CreateBehavior method

2. DebugMessageBehavior
- Validate method
	- no code in method currently

- AddBindingParameters
	- no code in method currently

- ApplyDispatchBehavior
	- adds the inspector for the WCF services, DebugMessageDispatcher

- AddBindingParameters
	no code in method currently

3. WCF Test Client comes up

4. Select AddTwoNumbers method in the CustomBinding section

5. Enter values into WCF Test Client

6. Click Invoke

7. DebugMessageDispatcher
- AfterReceiveRequest method
	- Determines if it should log the request
	- If so
		- Creates new Logger instance
		- Calls Log method to log the request

8. Logger
- Log method
	- Reads the message into an XML Document
	- Since this is WCF request, logs the message to the C:\Temp\WCF_Server_Side_Log_File.log
	- Rebuilds the message from the XML Document
	- Returns the message back to the caller

9. DebugMessageDispatcher
- AfterReceiveRequest method
	- If logging the request, the request is passed to the WCF Service

10. SimpleMathService
- AdditionOperations
	- AddTwoNumbers method

11. DebugMessageDispatcher
- BeforeSendReply method
	- Determines if it should log the request
	- If so
		- Creates new Logger instance
		- Calls Log method to log the request

12. Logger
- Log method
	- Same as above

13. WCF Test Client shows the result

14. You can repeat for the AddTwoNumbers method in the BasicHttpBidning section
