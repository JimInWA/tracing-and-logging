Web.config file in SimpleMathService (WCF service) was modified just enough to allow the hooks:
- system.serviceModel
	- behaviors
		- new endpointBehaviors section (this includes the debugDispatcher which is part of the extension section listed below)
	- new bindings section (this has the binding name used in the services section listed below)
	- new services section (this includes behaviorConfiguration, which seems to be the hook to the new endpointBehavior section)
	- new extension section (this includes the debugDispatcher listed in the endpointBehaviors section above)

In the SoapRequestAndResponseTracing project, set breakpoints on all of the methods and properties

Set the SimpleMathService project as the start up project

Set the AdditionOperatioins.svc as the start page

Press F5 to start up the WCF Test Client

Based on the breakpoints, here is the flow in the SoapRequestAndResponseTracing project:

1. DebugMessageBehaviorElement
- BehaviorType property, get
- BehaviorType property, get
- BehaviorType property, get
- BehaviorType property, get
- CreateBehavior method

2. DebugMessageBehavior
- Validate method (no code in method currently)
- AddBindingParameters (no code in method currently)
- ApplyDispatchBehavior (adds the message inspector)
- AddBindingParameters (no code in method currently)

3. WCF Test Client comes up

4. Select AddTwoNumbers method

5. enter values into WCF Test Client

6. Click Invoke

7. DebugMessageDispatcher
- AfterReceiveRequest method (only returns request right now)

8. SimpleMathService
- Service1
	- AddTwoNumbers method

9. DebugMessageDispatcher
- BeforeSendReply method (no code in method currently)

10. WCF Test Client shows the result
