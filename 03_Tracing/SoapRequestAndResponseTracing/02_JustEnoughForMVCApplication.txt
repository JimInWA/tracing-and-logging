Notes:
- SimpleMathService is using .NET 4.5 Framework
- SoapRequestAndResponseTracing is using to .NET 4.0 Framework
- SimpleMathClient is using .NET 4.0 Framework
	- This is to simulate a current situtation at work where our WCF service layer is 4.5 but our MVC application is 4.0

Based on:

Web.config file in SimpleMathClient (ASP.NET MVC Applicaiton)  was modified:
- appSettings
	- Added SoapRequestsAndResponsesShouldLog
- system.serviceModel
	- bindings
		- Added customBinding
	- behaviors
		- new endpointBehaviors section (this includes the debugInspector which is part of the extension section listed below)
	- client
		- updated the data (this includes behaviorConfiguration, which seems to be the hook to the new endpointBehavior section)
	- new extension section (this includes the debugInspector listed in the endpointBehaviors section above)


In a different instance of VS2013, start the SimpleMathService

In the SoapRequestAndResponseTracing project, set breakpoints in DebugMessageBehavior class on all of the methods

Set the SimpleMathClient project as the start up project

Press F5 to start up the SimpleMathClient

Based on the breakpoints, here is the flow in the SoapRequestAndResponseTracing project:

1. DebugMessageBehavior
- Validate method
	- no code in method currently

- AddBindingParameters
	- no code in method currently

- ApplyClientBehavior
	- adds the inspector for the WCF clients, DebugMessageInspector

2. The MVC Application starts up

3.
